# Introduction

Glassure is divided into two parts: The graphical user interface (GUI) and the calculation engine.
After installation the graphical user interface can be started by typing `glassure` in the command line.
The calculation engine can be used as a library in Python.
The main functionality is available in the `glassure.core` module.
The GUI is built on top of the calculation engine and can be found in the `glassure.gui` module.
It uses the same functions available in the calculation engine.

For an introduction to the graphical user interface, see [GUI](gui.md).

For an introduction to the calculation API, see [API](api.md).
