Welcome to Glassure's documentation!
====================================

Glassure is an open-source Python package for the analysis total scattering X-ray diffraction data.
It can be used to calculate structure factors and different forms of pair distribution functions.
It consists of an API to be used in your own scripts and a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive
data analysis. Special tools for the analysis of total scattering data coming from high pressure sources (e.g. diamond anvil cells
and Paris-Edinburgh Presses) are included in glassure.

The software is maintained by Clemens Prescher from the University of Freiburg, Germany.
