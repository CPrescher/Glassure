Welcome to Glassure's documentation!
====================================

Glassure is an open-source Python package for the analysis total scattering X-ray diffraction data. It can be used to
calculate structure factors (sometimes also called structure functions) and different forms of pair distribution
functions. It consists of an API to be used in your own scripts and a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive
data analysis. Special emphasis is on the analysis of data coming from high pressure sources (e.g. diamond anvil cells
and Paris-Edinburgh Presses).

The software is maintained by Clemens Prescher from the University of Freiburg, Germany.
